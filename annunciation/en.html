<h1>Annunciation</h1>
<!--https://www.ponomar.net/maktabah/MenaionLambertsenMarch2000/0325442.html-->

<p><kinovar>Troparion:</kinovar>
Today is the crown of our salvation&nbsp;/
and the revelation of the mystery which is from before the ages!&nbsp;/
The Son of God becometh the Son of the Virgin,&nbsp;/
and Gabriel announceth the glad tidings of grace.&nbsp;/
Wherefore, with him let us cry out to the Theotokos:&nbsp;/
Rejoice, O thou who art full of grace!&nbsp;/
The Lord is with thee!
</p>

<p><kinovar>Kontakion:</kinovar>
To thee, the champion leader,&nbsp;/
we, thy servants, dedicate hymns of victory and thanksgiving,&nbsp;/
as ones delivered from evils, O Theotokos;&nbsp;/
but in that thou hast invincible might,&nbsp;/
free us from all misfortunes, that we may cry to thee:&nbsp;/
Rejoice, O Bride unwedded!
</p>

<p><kinovar>Magnification:</kinovar>
We cry out to thee with the voice of the archangel, O pure one:&nbsp;/
Rejoice, O thou who art full of grace!&nbsp;/
The Lord is with thee!
