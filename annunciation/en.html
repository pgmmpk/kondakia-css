<h1>Annunciation</h1>

<p><kinovar>Troparion:</kinovar>
Today is the beginning of our salvation&nbsp;/
and the manifestation of the mystery
    which is from eternity.&nbsp;/
The Son of God becomes the Son of the Virgin,&nbsp;/
and Gabriel announces grace.&nbsp;/
So with him let us also cry to the Mother of God:&nbsp;/
Rejoice, thou who art full of grace!&nbsp;/
The Lord is with thee.
</p>

<p><kinovar>Kontakion:</kinovar>
Queen of the Heavenly Host, Defender of our souls,&nbsp;/
we thy servants offer to thee songs of victory and thanksgiving,&nbsp;/
for thou, O Mother of God, hast delivered us from dangers.&nbsp;/
But as thou hast invincible power,&nbsp;/
free us from conflicts of all kinds that we may cry to thee:&nbsp;/
Rejoice, unwedded Bride!
</p>

<p><kinovar>Magnification:</kinovar>
The Archangel's cry we sing to thee, O Pure One,&nbsp;/
Hail, thou who art full of grace,&nbsp;/
the Lord is with thee.
