<h1><kinovar>The Creed</kinovar></h1>
<!--https://www.ponomar.net/data/jordanville_prayerbook.pdf : page 14-->
<p>
<sup><kinovar>1</kinovar></sup>I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible.
<sup><kinovar>2</kinovar></sup>And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages. Light of light; true God of true God; begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made;
<sup><kinovar>3</kinovar></sup>Who for us men and for our salvation came down from the heavens, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man;
<sup><kinovar>4</kinovar></sup>And He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried;
<sup><kinovar>5</kinovar></sup>And arose again on the third day according to the Scriptures,
<sup><kinovar>6</kinovar></sup>And ascended into the heavens, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father;
<sup><kinovar>7</kinovar></sup>And shall come again, with glory, to judge both the living and the dead; Whose Kingdom shall have no end.
<sup><kinovar>8</kinovar></sup>And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life; Who proceedeth from the Father; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spake by the prophets.
<sup><kinovar>9</kinovar></sup>In One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.
<sup><kinovar>10</kinovar></sup>I confess one baptism for the remission of sins.
<sup><kinovar>11</kinovar></sup>I look for the resurrection of the dead,
<sup><kinovar>12</kinovar></sup>And the life of the age to come. Amen.
