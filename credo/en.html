<h1><kinovar>The Creed</kinovar></h1>
<p>
<sup><kinovar>1</kinovar></sup>I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth and of all things visible and invisible.
<sup><kinovar>2</kinovar></sup>And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the only-begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages. Light of light; true God of true God; begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made;
<sup><kinovar>3</kinovar></sup>Who for us men and for our salvation came down from Heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man.
<sup><kinovar>4</kinovar></sup>And He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried.
<sup><kinovar>5</kinovar></sup>And the third day He arose again, according to the Scriptures,
<sup><kinovar>6</kinovar></sup>and ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father;
<sup><kinovar>7</kinovar></sup>and He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead; Whose Kingdom shall have no end.
<sup><kinovar>8</kinovar></sup>And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke by the prophets.
<sup><kinovar>9</kinovar></sup>In one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.
<sup><kinovar>10</kinovar></sup>I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins.
<sup><kinovar>11</kinovar></sup>I look for the resurrection of the dead
<sup><kinovar>12</kinovar></sup>and the life of the world to come. Amen.
