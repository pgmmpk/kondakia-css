<h1>Dormition</h1>

<p><kinovar>Troparion:</kinovar>
In giving birth thou didst preserve thy virginity;&nbsp;/
in thy dormition thou didst not forsake the world, O Theotokos.&nbsp;/
Thou wast translated unto life,&nbsp;/
since thou art the Mother of Life;&nbsp;/
and by thine intercessions dost thou deliver our souls from death.
</p>

<p><kinovar>Kontakion:</kinovar>
On the mount Thou wast transfigured,&nbsp;/
and Thy disciples, as much as they could bear, beheld Thy glory, O Christ God;&nbsp;/
so that when they should see Thee crucified,&nbsp;/
they would know Thy passion to be willing,&nbsp;/
and would preach to the world&nbsp;/
that Thou, in truth, art the Effulgence of the Father.
</p>

<p><kinovar>Magnification:</kinovar>
We magnify You,&nbsp;/
most pure Mother of Christ out God,&nbsp;/
and we praise your&nbsp;/
all-glorious Dormition
</p>
