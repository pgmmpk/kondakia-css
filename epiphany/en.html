<h1>Epiphany</h1>
<p><kinovar>Troparion:</kinovar>
When Thou, O Lord, wast baptized in the Jordan&nbsp;/
the worship of the Trinity was made manifest!&nbsp;/
For the voice of the Father bare witness to Thee,&nbsp;/
calling Thee his Beloved Son.&nbsp;/
And the Spirit, in the form of a dove,&nbsp;/
confirmed the truthfulness of his Word.&nbsp;/
O Christ our God, who hast revealed Thyself&nbsp;/
and hast enlightened the world, glory to Thee
</p>

<p><kinovar>Kontakion:</kinovar>
Today Thou hast appeared to the universe,&nbsp;/
and Thy Light, O Lord, has shone on us,&nbsp;/
who with understanding praise Thee:&nbsp;/
Thou hast come and revealed Thyself,&nbsp;/
O Light Unapproachable!
</p>

<p><kinovar>Magnification:</kinovar>
We magnify thee,&nbsp;/
O Christ, Giver of Life,&nbsp;/
who for our sake now art baptized in the flesh&nbsp;/
by John&nbsp;/
in the waters of the Jordan.
