<h1>Nativity</h1>

<p><kinovar>Troparion:</kinovar>
Your Nativity, O Christ our God,&nbsp;/
Has shone to the world the Light of wisdom!&nbsp;/
For by it, those who worshipped the stars,&nbsp;/
Were taught by a Star to adore You,&nbsp;/
The Sun of Righteousness,&nbsp;/
And to know You, the Orient from on High.&nbsp;/
O Lord, glory to You!
</p>

<p><kinovar>Kontakion:</kinovar>
Today the Virgin gives birth to the Transcendent One,&nbsp;/
And the earth offers a cave to the Unapproachable One!&nbsp;/
Angels with shepherds glorify Him!&nbsp;/
The wise men journey with a star!&nbsp;/
Since for our sake the Eternal God was born!&nbsp;/
as a Little Child!
</p>

<p><kinovar>Magnification:</kinovar>
We magnify Thee,&nbsp;/
O Christ, Giver of Life,&nbsp;/
who for our sake now art born in the flesh!&nbsp;/
of the unwedded and most pure Virgin Mary.
