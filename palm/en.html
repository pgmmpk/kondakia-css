<h1>The Entrance of the Lord into Jerusalem</h1>
<p><kinovar>Troparion:</kinovar>
By raising Lazarus from the dead before Thy passion,&nbsp;/
Thou didst confirm the universal resurrection, O Christ God!&nbsp;/
Like the children with the branches of victory,&nbsp;/
we cry out to Thee, O Vanquisher of Death:&nbsp;/
Hosanna in the highest!&nbsp;/
Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord!
</p>

<p><kinovar>Kontakion:</kinovar>
Sitting on Thy throne in heaven,&nbsp;/
and carried on a foal on earth, O Christ God,&nbsp;/
accept the praise of angels&nbsp;/
and the songs of children who sing:&nbsp;/
Blessed is he who comes to recall Adam!
</p>

<p><kinovar>Magnification</kinovar>
We magnify Thee,&nbsp;/
O Christ, Giver of Life,&nbsp;/
and we sing to thee,&nbsp;/
Hosanna in the highest.&nbsp;/
Blessed is He that cometh&nbsp;/
in the name of the Lord.
