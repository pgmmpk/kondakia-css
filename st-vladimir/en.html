<h1>St. Vladimir</h1>
<p><kinovar>Troparion:</kinovar>
Seated on the high throne of Kiev, the mother of cities saved by God,&nbsp;/
thou didst emulate the merchant who sought the goodly pearl,&nbsp;/
O Vladimir glorious in might,&nbsp;/
and examining and sending emissaries to the Imperial City to learn about the Orthodox Faith,&nbsp;/
thou didst find Christ the priceless Pearl, Who chose thee as a second Paul&nbsp;/
and in the holy font removed thy blindness, spiritual and bodily.&nbsp;/
Wherefore, we, thy people, celebrate thy repose.&nbsp;/
Pray thou, that Russia, thy land, be saved,&nbsp;//
and that peace and great mercy be granted to the Orthodox people.
</p>

<p><kinovar>Kontakion:</kinovar>
Emulating the great Apostle Paul in thy maturity,&nbsp;/
O most glorious Vladimir,&nbsp;/
and putting aside all thy zeal for idols as childish thoughts,&nbsp;/
thou hast adorned thyself with the purple robe of divine baptism.&nbsp;/
And standing now in gladness before Christ the Savior,&nbsp;/
pray thou that Russia, thy land, be saved,&nbsp;/
and that peace and great mercy be granted to the Orthodox people.
</p>

<p><kinovar>Magnification</kinovar>
We magnify thee,&nbsp;/
O holy Prince Vladimir, equal of the apostles,&nbsp;/
and we honor the holy memory of thee&nbsp;/
who trampled the idols underfoot&nbsp;/
and hast enlightened the whole land of Russia&nbsp;/
with holy baptism.
