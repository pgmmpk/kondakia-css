<h1>The Transfiguration</h1>

<p><kinovar>Troparion:</kinovar>
Thou wast transfigured on the mountain, O Christ our God,&nbsp;/
showing to Thy disciples Thy glory as each one could endudre;&nbsp;/
shine forth Thou on us, who are sinners all, Thy light ever-unending&nbsp;/
through the prayers of the Theotokos, O Light-giver, glory to Thee.
</p>

<p><kinovar>Kontakion:</kinovar>
On the mount Thou wast transfigured,&nbsp;/
and Thy disciples, as much as they could bear, beheld Thy glory, O Christ God;&nbsp;/
so that when they should see Thee crucified,&nbsp;/
they would know Thy passion to be willing,&nbsp;/
and would preach to the world&nbsp;/
that Thou, in truth, art the Effulgence of the Father.
</p>

<p><kinovar>Magnification</kinovar>
We magnify Thee,&nbsp;/
O Life-Giving Christ,&nbsp;/
and we do homage to the exceedingly glorious&nbsp;/
Transfiguration of thy Body most pure.
</p>
