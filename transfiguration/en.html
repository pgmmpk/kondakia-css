<h1>Holy Transfiguration</h1>

<p><kinovar>Troparion:</kinovar>
<!--https://www.ponomar.net/maktabah/MenaionLambertsenAugust2000/0806485.html-->
Thou wast transfigured on the mountain, O Christ God,&nbsp;/
Who didst show Thy glory unto Thy disciples as far as they could bear it.&nbsp;/
May Thine ever-existing light shine forth also upon us sinners&nbsp;/
through the prayers of the Theotokos. O Bestower of light, glory be to Thee!
</p>

<p><kinovar>Kontakion:</kinovar>
On the mountain wast Thou transfigured,&nbsp;/
and Thy disciples beheld Thy glory as far as they could bear it, O Christ God;&nbsp;/
that when they would see Thee crucified,&nbsp;/
they would comprehend that Thy suffering was voluntary,&nbsp;/
and proclaim to the world&nbsp;/
that Thou art of a truth the Effulgence of the Father.
</p>

<p><kinovar>Magnification</kinovar>
We magnify Thee,&nbsp;/
O Christ Bestower of light,&nbsp;/
and we honor the all-glorious transfiguration&nbsp;/
of Thine all-pure flesh.
